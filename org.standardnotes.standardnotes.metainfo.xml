    <p>NOTE: This release is not verified by, affiliated with, or supported by Standard Notes Ltd.</p>

    <p>Standard Notes is a simple and private notes app. It syncs your notes securely across all your devices, including
      your Android devices, Windows, iOS, Linux, and Web.</p>

    <p>Private means your notes are end-to-end encrypted, so only you can read your notes. Even we can't read the contents
      of your notes.</p>

    <p>Simple means it does one job and does it well. Standard Notes is a safe and lasting place for your life's work. Our
      focus is making it easy to write notes wherever you are and syncing them with encryption to all your devices.</p>

    <p>Our users love us for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Notes</li>
      <li>Tasks &amp; Todos</li>
      <li>Passwords &amp; Keys</li>
      <li>Code &amp; Technical Procedures</li>
      <li>Private Journal</li>
      <li>Meeting Notes</li>
      <li>Cross-platform Scratchpad</li>
      <li>Books, Recipes, &amp; Movies</li>
      <li>Health &amp; Fitness Log</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Standard Notes comes free with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seamless sync across all your devices, with easy to use applications on Android, Windows, Linux, iPhone, iPad,
          Mac,
          and web browsers.</li>
      <li>Offline access, so you can access your downloaded notes even without a connection.</li>
      <li>No limit on number of devices.</li>
      <li>No limit on number of notes.</li>
      <li>Passcode lock protection, along with fingerprint protection.</li>
      <li>A tagging system to organize your notes (like #work, #ideas, #passwords, #crypto).</li>
      <li>The ability to pin, lock, protect, and move notes to trash, which allows you to recover deleted notes until the
          trash is emptied.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Standard Notes is completely open-source, which means when we say your notes are encrypted with AES-256 encryption,
      and that only you can read your notes, you don't have to take our word for it. Our code is open to the world to
      audit.</p>

    <p>We made Standard Notes simple because longevity is important to us. We want to make sure we're here, protecting your
      notes, for the next hundred years. You shouldn't have to find a new notes app every year.</p>

    <p>To sustain our development, we offer an optional paid program called Standard Notes Extended. Extended gives you
      access to powerful tools including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Productivity editors (like Markdown, Code, Spreadsheets)</li>
      <li>Beautiful themes (like Midnight, Focus, Solarized Dark)</li>
      <li>Powerful cloud tools including daily backups of your encrypted data delivered to your email inbox every day, or
          backed up to your cloud provider (like Dropbox and Google Drive).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can learn more about Extended at standardnotes.org/extended.</p>
